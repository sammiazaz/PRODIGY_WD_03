## Features

* **Interactive Game Board:** A 3x3 grid where players can click to place their markers.
* **Turn Management:** Automatically switches between 'X' and 'O' players.
* **Win Detection:** Algorithm to determine if a player has achieved three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
* **Draw Detection:** Recognizes when all cells are filled without a winner.
* **Game Reset:** A button to start a new game at any point.
* **Player vs. Player Mode:** Allows two human players to compete.
* **Optional: AI Opponent:** (If implemented) Play against a basic computer AI.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the game board and other elements.
* **CSS3:** For styling the game board, markers, and overall layout, providing a visually appealing interface.
